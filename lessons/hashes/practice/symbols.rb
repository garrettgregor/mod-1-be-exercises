# Remember in Ruby, symbols are basically Strings that canâ€™t change.
# You can recognize a symbol because it starts with a colon :.
# All of the following are symbols:
# :name
# :symbols_can_have_underscores
# :"symbols can be in quotes"

# Lets change the hash above to use symbols instead of strings.
